/**
 * Reads a recorded-request list out of an admin-API response body, for the imposter-wide journal and
 * the space-scoped view alike — both are the same list in the same two shapes, and reading them in
 * two places is how they came to drift.
 *
 * <p>Strict about the container, lenient about the elements. The two accepted shapes are a bare
 * array (what the engine serves) and a {@code {"requests":[...]}} envelope; anything else is a
 * {@link CommunicationError}, not an empty journal. The distinction matters because the caller
 * cannot make it: "recorded nothing" is a perfectly ordinary answer, so a 2xx whose body is not a
 * journal at all — an engine bug answering an error with status 200, a proxy substituting a page —
 * would otherwise read as fact, with nothing to correlate against. Element-level leniency stays: a
 * field the engine omits comes back empty rather than failing the whole read, because per-protocol
 * and per-version shape drift there is expected (see {@link RecordedRequest#read}).
